Whiteboard Challenge 03
Complete today's whiteboard challenge and follow the submission instructions below:

You're the junior conductor on a commuter train, and have been asked by the senior conductor to do a head count of passengers on the train.

Write a function const traverse = (engine) => {... which takes the engine as a starting location. Travel from the engine to the caboose, and console.log the number of passengers in each car as your progress. Each car, including the engine will have the following signature: js { <engine> value: 2, next: { <next car> value: 16, next: { <next car> } }

With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on Github. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
This folder should contain:
A directory __test__ including a file for your solution, e.g. solution.test.js
A file named "solution.js" which contains the JavaScript solution
A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
A package.json including jest as an installed dev-dependency
A README.md which includes the problem domain
Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
Include at least three unit tests for each function that you write for your solution.
Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
Submit a link to your PR on Canvas.
