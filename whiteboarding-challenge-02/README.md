Complete today's whiteboard challenge and follow the submission instructions below:

Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties: - The highest and second highest value in the array

Write at least four tests for this function - Your tests should cover basic functionality - Consider any edge cases for your function, e.g. will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?
